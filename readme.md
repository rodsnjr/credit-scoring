This is a Udacity Machine Learning Capstone Project.

The `proposal.pdf` contains the specifications for this project.

This project focus on the Kaggle Competition called [Give Me Some Credit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit).

The Capstone is split on these files:

* Data Analysis and Visualization(`Data.ipynb`): Which contains a notebook, with the initial study on the dataset behavior;
* Data Analysis and Visualization(`Data-Transform.ipynb`): Which contains a notebook, with the feature extractions for the dataset;
* Capstone Study(`Study.ipynb`): Which contains the main code and the study;
* Utilities(`utils.py`): Which contains the dataset loading, and other utilities;
* Plotting(`plots.py`): Contains the plotting helpers;
* Report(`report.pdf`): The report file for the study;
* Requirements(`requirements.txt`): Basic python file for the libs used in the project.

Also, the dataset is in the `dataset` folder, along with some of the submission files.
